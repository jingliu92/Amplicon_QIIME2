## Workflow for Analyzing 16S rRNA Data in QIIME 2:
1. Input Preparation:
   * Import raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) along with sample metadata into the QIIME 2 framework.
  
2. Quality Control:
   * Perform read quality filtering, trimming, and denoising using tools like DADA2 or Deblur to generate high-quality representative sequences and feature tables.

3. Taxonomic Classification:
   * Assign taxonomy to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using reference databases such as SILVA, Greengenes, or GTDB.

4. Diversity Analysis:
   * valuate alpha diversity (within-sample metrics, e.g., Shannon Index) and beta diversity (between-sample metrics, e.g., Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) to explore community structure and differences.

5. Visualization:
   * Generate intuitive, interactive plots, such as taxonomic composition plots, rarefaction curves, and PCOA plots.

6. Statistical Testing:
   * Conduct differential abundance testing to identify taxa associated with specific conditions or treatments.
